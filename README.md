# Xbox 360 Controller USB Adapter

This is an adapter that allows you to connect an Xbox 360 controller to a PC via USB. It works with the Xiao RP2040, but can presumably be ported to other microcontrollers. It is pretty simple, and I did not invent all the codeâ€”AI helped me a lot.

## What You Need

- An Xbox RF board (Slim or Full Fat)
- A microcontroller (I use the Xiao RP2040)
- A USB-C port/cable
- Some basic soldering knowledge

## Wiring

I've included some basic wiring diagrams.
You also have to select the drivers manually on the computer they're not that hard to find

This is the case I used
